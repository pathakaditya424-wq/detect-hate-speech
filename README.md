# Hate Speech Detection (Streamlit App)

This project is a **Streamlit-based web app** for detecting hate speech in text.  
The model classifies text into two categories:
- **1 = Toxic**  
- **2 = Neutral**

## üöÄ Features
- Simple and interactive Streamlit UI  
- Real-time text classification  
- Easy to run locally or deploy on Streamlit Cloud  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Accuracy
The dataset used contains some similarities between positive expressions (like *"love"*) and negative expressions (hate-related).  
Because of this, the model may **occasionally give incorrect results**.  
For example:
- "I love this" ‚Üí might sometimes be predicted as hate speech.  
- Similar words across different contexts can confuse the model.  

This limitation exists due to dataset overlap and can be improved in the future with more refined data.
